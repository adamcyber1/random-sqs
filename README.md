# random-sqs

A simple program to test the Amazon SQS product. Just messing around.

## Installation
To configure, modify `random-sqs.env` with your paramters, and your QUEUE_URL for your Amazon SQS instance.

`sudo make install`
`sudo systemctl start random-sqs`

You will need to add your .aws/config and .aws/configuration files to /root for the system service to run properly.
